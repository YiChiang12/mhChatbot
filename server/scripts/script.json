It sounds like a lot to juggle, and I can understand how that would be impacting your ability to stay on top of things and get the rest you need. Let's start by addressing the schedule issue. It can be helpful to break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks, and prioritize them based on urgency and importance. Additionally, consider setting more realistic expectations for what you can accomplish in a day. Sometimes we put too much pressure on ourselves to do it all at once. Taking breaks and practicing self-care are crucial in maintaining a healthy balance. As for the noisy roommate situation, have you tried talking to them about the noise issue? Communication is key in resolving conflicts like these. They may not even realize that their music is disturbing your sleep. Setting boundaries and finding a compromise together can make a huge difference in improving your living situation. Remember, it's essential to take care of yourself during this challenging time. Prioritize your well-being and seek support when needed. Would you like to discuss any specific strategies or further explore these topics?"
