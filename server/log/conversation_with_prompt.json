When you do decide to reach out, it’s perfectly okay to take your time with your words, and you don’t have to share everything all at once.\n\nIf you need support or want to talk about what it was like after you connect with them, I’m here to listen. You’re taking steps that matter, and it’s okay to be wherever you are in this journey. How are you feeling about this decision now? 🌼✨",
