The job market can be incredibly competitive, and many factors play into those hiring decisions that are often beyond your control. üåßÔ∏è \n\nSometimes, rejections can stem from aspects like:\n\n1. **High Competition**: There may be a pool of candidates who are just as qualified, making selection difficult.\n  \n2. **Company Fit**: Sometimes it‚Äôs not just about qualifications or grades; it‚Äôs also about finding the right fit for the company culture or specific needs.\n\n3. **Timing**: Occasionally, positions can be filled quickly, or priorities shift, leading to outcomes that are not a reflection of your abilities.\n\nHave you had the opportunity to ask for feedback from those companies after receiving a rejection? Sometimes getting insight can help in understanding areas where you could improve or adjust your approach. \n\nAlso, it‚Äôs okay to allow yourself some space to process these rejections. They do not define your worth or future opportunities. How do you feel about that perspective? üíñ‚ú®",
