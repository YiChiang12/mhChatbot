It can help process emotions and clarify your next steps.\n\n2. **Celebrating Small Wins**: Acknowledge even the smallest accomplishments, like sending an application or getting a reply email, and give yourself a little reward—like a treat or time spent on a favorite activity!\n\n3. **Peer Support**: If there are friends or classmates in similar situations, consider having regular check-ins with each other to share experiences and motivate one another.\n\n4. **Affirmations or Positive Quotes**: Find a few affirmations or inspiring quotes that resonate with you, and display them where you can see them regularly. Reading them can reframe your mindset.\n\n5. **Limit Comparisons**: Set boundaries around social media or environments that trigger comparisons with others. Give yourself space to focus on your own journey.\n\n6. **Short Breaks**: Allow yourself to take breaks to recharge when job searching feels heavy. Go for a walk, meditate, or do something lighthearted!\n\nDo any of these resonate with you? Or would you like to explore other options? Your comfort and needs are the priority here. 💖✨",
