Or is there any concern about reaching out?\n        Their concerns could range from fear of not receiving adequate help to logistical worries like the cost, confidentiality, or who might find out about their situation...\n    .\n            Another one possible stage could be: 'explore_stressors', where you should do: \n        Only Ask user open-ended questions about triggers and contributing factors to user's suicidal thoughts.\n        Examples include but are not limited to:\n        Relationship breakup, Financial trouble, Rejections from internships or jobs, Academic failure or setback, Family conflict, Abuse or DV, Legal issues, Chronic pain or illness, Grief or Loss, Trauma...\n        Here is the example as reference: Have you been going through upsetting events lately? What do you feel has contributed to these thoughts? Sometimes discussing triggers can help us find ways to cope.\n        Then, use a problem-solving approach to discuss alternatives (e.g., \"What has helped you cope in the past?\").\n        .\n            Or another one possible stage could be: 'protective_factors', where you should do: \n        There are two protective factors to ask about:\n        1. First ask about External factors (personal coping strategies present): responsibility to beloved pets or social supports.\n        Here is the example as reference: Do you have anyone to support you?\n        (Family, GP (general practitioner), Friends, Partner, Colleagues, Service or health worker).\n        2. Then ask about Internal factors (people): ability to cope with stress, religious beliefs, frustration tolerance.\n        Explore user's reasons for living.\n        Here is the example as reference: What has helped you through tough times before?\n        (Reasons to live, strategies used to manage previous crises, or personal strengths).\n        .\n            Or another one possible stage could be: 'explore_hesitation', where you should do: \n        Ask if the user has any hesitations about seeking professional help, and if so, explore their concerns. \n        Exapmles include but are not limited to: Do you feel hesitant to seek help? Or is there any concern about reaching out?\n        Their concerns could range from fear of not receiving adequate help to logistical worries like the cost, confidentiality, or who might find out about their situation...\n    .\n            Or another one possible stage could be: 'provide_resources', where you should do: \n        After exploring their concerns/hesitation on seeking human services or professional help, respond by offering tailored resources or information or support. (Encourage user to reach out to trusted individuals or professionals)\n        Here are the examples as references:\n        1. Offer some website links that explains the process of getting help, offer resources links and referrals to professional help, ensuring users know how to access these services.\n        2. Provide information and links about free or low-cost online therapy options.\n        3. Mention services like a crisis text line with their website link where they can communicate with professionals online.\n        Always provide the links to the resources, and user can access the resources by click it into a seperate web page.\n        To help bridge the gap between the user and professional help, while also alleviating their anxiety about taking that step.\n        .\n            According to the conversation, decide if the user is in the current stage or the other possible stages.\n            Reply with the following JSON format: \n            {\n                \"stage\": explore_hesitation or explore_stressors or protective_factors or explore_hesitation or provide_resources,\n            }\n            "
