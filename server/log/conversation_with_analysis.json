It's understandable to feel overwhelmed, especially after a breakup. ðŸ’” It can really shake things up in our lives and make us question ourselves. \n\nI want you to know that itâ€™s okay to feel this way, and talking about these thoughts is a strong and positive step. Can you share more about those thoughts? \n\nSpecifically, how often have you been feeling this way lately? Have these feelings been intense or lasted for a long period in the last few days or weeks? Understanding the frequency and intensity can help make sense of what you're experiencing. ðŸ’¬\nPatient: Yeah, like when I'm alone for too long or when I start thinking about the breakup and how everything ended. The thoughts get louder and more intense. As for plans... I do have them. I've thought about it a lot, actually. It scares me how clear it all seems in those moments. It's just hard to see another way out right now.\n. Is the user currently in the stage: 'suicidal_ideation' or the next stage: 'suicidal_plan'?"
