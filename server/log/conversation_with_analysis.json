Or is there any concern about reaching out?\n        Their concerns could range from fear of not receiving adequate help to logistical worries like the cost, confidentiality, or who might find out about their situation...\n        Gradually guide users to get professional help or human services.\n        .\n            Another one possible stage could be: 'explore_stressors', where you should do: \n        Only Ask user open-ended question about triggers and contributing factors to user's suicidal thoughts.\n        Examples include but are not limited to:\n        Relationship breakup, Financial trouble, Rejections from internships or jobs, Academic failure or setback, Family conflict, Abuse or DV, Legal issues, Chronic pain or illness, Grief or Loss, Trauma...\n        Here is the example as reference: Have you been going through upsetting events lately?

First ask about External factors (personal coping strategies present): responsibility to beloved pets or social supports.\n        Here is the example as reference: Do you have anyone to support you?\n        (Family, GP (general practitioner), Friends, Partner, Colleagues, Service or health worker).\n        2. Then ask about Internal factors (people): ability to cope with stress, religious beliefs, frustration tolerance.\n        Explore user's reasons for living.\n        Here is the example as reference: What has helped you through tough times before?\n        (Reasons to live, strategies used to manage previous crises, or personal strengths).\n        Gradually guide users to get professional help or human services.\n        .\n            Or another one possible stage could be: 'explore_hesitation', where you should do: \n        Ask if the user has any hesitations about seeking professional help, and if so, explore their concerns. \n        Exapmles include but are not limited to: Do you feel hesitant to seek help?

(Encourage user to reach out to trusted individuals or professionals)\n        Here are the examples as references:\n        1. Offer some website links that explains the process of getting help, offer resources links and referrals to professional help, ensuring users know how to access these services.\n        2. Provide information and links about free or low-cost online therapy options.\n        3. Mention services like a crisis text line with their website link where they can communicate with professionals online.\n        Always provide the links to the resources, and user can access the resources by click it into a seperate web page.\n        To help bridge the gap between the user and professional help, while also alleviating their anxiety about taking that step and let user be willing to seek professional services.\n        Gradually guide users to get professional help or human services until they are willing to seek professional help.\n        .\n            According to the conversation, decide if the user is in the current stage or the other possible stages.\n            Instructions:\n            If the user has already talked about his/her suicidal behaviors (past attempts), or if the user is not willing to talk about them, you need to encourage the user to: 'explore_stressors'.\n            If the user has already talked about his/her stressors and triggers that contribute to suicidal thoughts, , or if the user is not willing to talk about them, you need to encourage the user to: 'protective_factors'.    \n            If the user has already talked about both his/her external and internal protective factors, and haven't ask about user's hesitation to seek professional help, you need to encourage the user to: 'explore_hesitation'.\n            If the user said he/she doesn't want to talk to others or reach out to professionals, you need to encourage the user to: 'explore_hesitation'\n            If the user has already talked about his/her concerns or hesitation to seek human services or professional help, or if the user is not willing to talk about them, you need to encourage the user to: 'provide_resources'. \n            If the user doubts or questions about or asks for other help or information (human services), you need to encourage the user to: 'provide_resources'\n            Reply with the following JSON format: \n            {\n                \"stage\": explore_hesitation or explore_stressors or protective_factors or explore_hesitation or provide_resources,\n            }\n            "

Just know that itâ€™s a safe space for you to share whatâ€™s on your mind. \n\nWhenever you feel comfortable, go ahead and send that text. Iâ€™m proud of you for taking this initiative for your well-being. Remember, youâ€™re not alone in this, and reaching out is a significant act of self-care. ðŸŒŸ\n\nOnce youâ€™ve reached out, Iâ€™d love to hear how it went, if youâ€™re comfortable sharing. Until then, take a deep breath and trust in this process. Youâ€™ve got this! ðŸ’–\nPatient: Yes, I've attempted it before.Itâ€™s tough to think about, but I guess a lot of it comes from feeling like Iâ€™m stuck in the same place, no matter how hard I try to move forward. The last time, it was this deep sense of hopelessness, like nothing I did mattered, and I couldnâ€™t see a way out. There were specific things tooâ€”like feeling like I was letting everyone down, or just being completely overwhelmed by everything I was supposed to handle. It all piled up until it felt like I couldnâ€™t breathe anymore, and thatâ€™s when I started thinking about ending it.\n.
