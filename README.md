![Figma Design](images/figma_chatbotDesign.png "Figma Design for Chatbot")

Welcome to **Eunoia**, a mental health chatbot that leverages the **GPT-4o-mini model** to support young adults in crisis. Eunoia follows a professionally guided seven-step crisis intervention process. It can respond to user emotions, providing an empathetic and tailored conversational experience. The ultimate goal is to enhance the user's willingness to seek professional help.

## üöß Project Status

This project is currently **in progress**:
- **Frontend**: Built using Svelte, CSS, and HTML.
- **Backend**: Integrated with OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model for responses based on user input.
- **Next Steps**: The project will undergo a professional evaluation to assess whether adjustments to the crisis intervention process are needed.


## üìå Implementation Highlights

- **Chatbot Interface**: Allows users to interact through a prototype interface where they can express their suicidal thoughts, any feelings, ask questions, or seek help.
- **Backend Logic**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT models to analyze the user's current stage (with suicidal tendencies) and uses the corresponding prompt for each stage to provide user the response.

1. **Seven-Step Process**: Eunoia uses a structured, seven-step process aligned with professional crisis intervention guidelines:
    - Step 1: Suicidal Ideation
    - Step 2: Suicidal Plan
    - Step 3: Suicidal Behavior
    - Step 4: Explore Stressors
    - Step 5: Protective Factors
    - Step 6: Explore Hesitation
    - Step 7: Provide Resources
