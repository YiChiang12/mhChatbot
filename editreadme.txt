## üöß Project Status
This project is currently **in progress**:
- The chatbot interface using Svelte, CSS, and HTML is operational.
- Backend integration using OpenAI's GPT model for generating dynamic conversations based on user input.
<!-- - Figma designs for the conversational flow map are complete, but the implementation into the chatbot is pending. -->

## üìå Current Implementation
- **Chatbot Interface**: Allows users to interact through a prototype interface where they can express their suicidal thoughts, any feelings, ask questions, or seek help.
- **Backend Logic**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT models to analyze the user's current stage (with suicidal tendencies) and using the corresponding prompt for each stage to provide user the response.
